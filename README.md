# CandyBox

This is my graduate project for university. Feel Free to leave any comment.

CandyBox is a web App(currently) to get songs that DJ is playing in the club real-timely.

Get the meta info from Traktor-SongNameServer (https://github.com/drumsoft/Traktor-SongNameServer) and then show it to the client.

I'm stick to the situation that this app will be used in the club or some festival like ULTRA.
Real-Time feature is the key of this app.

Also I need to put more function that can communicate with DJ and audience.(ex. put "like", "dislike" button and DJ can know how people reacting right now)
